# VBA Homework - The VBA of Wall Street

## Objective

The Wall Street of VBA by using the stock market analysis by finding the solution in three different ways: Easy, Moderate, and Hard.

The VBA of Wall Street will use a script that will analyze the stock market by focusing on the years 2014-2016.

Easy: 
.First you will create a script that will loop through the years of the stock market.
.Then focus on the total amount of each stock by using the volume over the three years
.Then you will show the ticker symbol which will correspond with the total volume.

Here is screenshot analysis for easy 






Moderate:
 First you will design a script that will loop through all three stocks. Here are the following steps
 - The yearly change from the stock opened and the year of the closing price
 - Then find the percent change from what is opened to the year of what is closed
 - Used the total volume of the stocks
 - Use the ticker symbol
 - Highlight the positive in the green and negetive in red by using the conditioning formatting
 
 Hard
 - Used the solution that will include everything that was in the moderate
 - Find the solution to locate the stock by using these three:
 " Greatest % increase, " Greatest % Decrease" and the greatest total volume".
   Remember to use the script that will run on every sheet


* [Test Data](Resources/alphabetical_testing.xlsx) - Use this while developing your scripts.

* [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - Run your scripts on this data to generate the final homework report.

## Instructions

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

* The result should look as follows.

### CHALLENGES

1. Your solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". The solution will look as follows:

2. Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.

### Other Considerations

* Use the sheet `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` while developing your code. This data set is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in less than 3-5 minutes.

* Make sure that the script acts the same on each sheet. The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive task and run over and over again with a click of the button.

## Submission

* To submit please upload the following to Github:

  * A screen shot for each year of your results on the Multi Year Stock Data.

  * VBA Scripts as separate files.

* Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits), a thorough README.md file

* After everything has been saved, create a sharable link and submit that to <https://bootcampspot-v2.com/>.
