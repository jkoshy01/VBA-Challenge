# The VBA of Wall Street

## Objective

Analyzing the stock market by finding the solution in three different ways: Easy, Moderate, and Hard.

The VBA of Wall Street will use a script that will analyze the stock market by focusing on the years 2014-2016.

Easy Solution: 

-First you will create a script that will loop through the years of the stock market.

-Then focus on the total amount of each stock by using the volume over the three years

-Then you will show the ticker symbol which will correspond with the total volume.


 
Moderate Solution:
 
 First you will design a script that will loop through all three stocks. Here are the following steps
 
 - The yearly change from the stock opened price and the year of the closing price
 
 - Then you will find the percent change from the open price in the starting of that year to the closing price at the end of the year
 
 - Used the total volume of the stocks
 
 - Use the ticker symbol
 
 - Highlight the positive in the green and negetive in red by using the conditioning formatting
 
 
 
 Hard Solution
  
  
   Use the solution that will include everything that was in the moderate script

  - Find the solution to locate the stock by using these three:
 
 -  Greatest % increase, " Greatest % Decrease" and the greatest total volume".
  
 - "Remember to use the script that will run on every sheet".
